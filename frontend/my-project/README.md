# DevSoc Frontend Application

I have done stretch tasks 1 and 2 in my project, there are a few personal design choices that made it a bit easier to code but also makes sense design wise such as moving the search bar to the left and having the filter/sort buttons together on the right. This made it easier to code for responsiveness whilst also making the buttons appear feel more cohesive.

Otherwise I've also made the searchbar work so you can search by the names of buildings and dark mode also works. The dark mode toggle also preserves through refreshes and page visits by storing the value in localstorage.
